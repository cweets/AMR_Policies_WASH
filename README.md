# AMR_Policies_WASH

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an imminent and accelerating threat to human health and may exacerbate the existing burden of disease for populations without access to safe Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH). We endeavoured to comprehensively map and detail the current global regulatory environment for WASH policies with implications for the development of AMR in waterborne microorganisms. Understanding what policies exist is a crucial first step towards assessing, at scale, which policies are effective, and under what circumstances, in addressing the global health threat of AMR. This github repository contains data, analyses, and data vizualizations of our 193 country project to describe and analyze enforceable policies for WASH sectors. This work is part of the broader AMP for EID project.
